# üß¨ DNA Sequence Comparison and Online BLAST Search

This project demonstrates how to **compare DNA sequences locally** and perform an **online BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)** search using Biopython.  

It has two main parts:
1. **Local FASTA Reading & Comparison** ‚Äî reads local FASTA files, aligns two sequences character-by-character, and calculates a simple similarity score.  
2. **Online BLAST Search** ‚Äî submits sequences to the NCBI BLAST database and retrieves possible matching genes or organisms.

## üöÄ Features

- Read and parse DNA sequences from FASTA files.  
- Perform simple local sequence comparison with match, mismatch, and gap penalties.  
- Perform online **nucleotide BLAST (blastn)** using Biopython‚Äôs `NCBIWWW.qblast()`.  
- Parse and display key BLAST hit details such as:
  - Alignment titles  
  - E-values and scores  
  - Query/subject ranges  
  - Sequence identity and gaps

Would you like me to make this README **more concise** (for a GitHub repo) or **more detailed** (for a lab/project report submission)?
